1.I first test for .txt to check how strict the filter actually is (if it says only images .jpg .png .gif are allowed for example) and then move on from there.
2. As well as this just simply uploading three different image types (.png .gif and .jpg) can give you an indication as to how they are handling uploads.
3. For example are all photos saved as the same format regardless of the photo type we uploaded?
4. Are they not trusting any of our input and always saving as .jpg regardless?
5.what happens if you name the file “zseano.php/.jpg”  the code may see “.jpg” and think “ok” but the server actually writes it to the server as zseano.php and misses everything after the forward slash.
6.Try zseano.html%0d%0a.jpg The server will see “.jpg” but because %0d%0a are newline characters it is saved as zseano.html
7.Try smuggling xss characters in file names eg:
filename="58832_300x300.jpg<svg onload=confirm()>"
8.What is the developer checking for exactly and how are they handling it? Are they trusting any of our input? For example if I provide it with:
------WebKitFormBoundaryAxbOlwnrQnLjU1j9
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="imageupload"; filename="zseano.jpg"
Content-Type: text/html
9.Does the code see “.jpg” and think “Image extension, must be ok!” but trust my content-type and reflect it as Content-Type:text/html?
10. Or does it set content-type based on the file extension? 
11.What happens if you provide it with NO file extension (or file name!), will it default to the content-type or file extension?
------WebKitFormBoundaryAxbOlwnrQnLjU1j9
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="imageupload"; filename="zseano."
Content-Type: text/html
------WebKitFormBoundaryAxbOlwnrQnLjU1j9
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="imageupload"; filename=".html"
Content-Type: image/png
<html>HTML code!</html>
